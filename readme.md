# Our MHacks 2020 Project: Covalent! 

We got the inspiration for our project's name from chemistry, specifically "covalent bonds". We are building our app to help students and basically everyone connect with similar people (e.g. people in same classes, people in same city).

We are building a full stack web application using the languages, Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. One of our members has experience with Flask and MongoDB. Everyone has an elementary/beginner understanding of front end development. 

We are planning on building an algorithm to match users based on team and friendship compatability to help during these trying times. It might be too ambitious but we are trying!
